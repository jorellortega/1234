# Image Generation Setup (DALL-E 3)

## Overview
Your INFINITO AI platform now supports **image generation** using DALL-E 3 by OpenAI for high-quality static images!

**Note**: RunwayML is used exclusively for **video generation** (VIDEO MODE). RunwayML's API requires an image input for video generation and doesn't support pure text-to-image generation through their current SDK.

## Quick Start

### 1. API Key (Already Set Up)
Your OpenAI API key is already configured in your database for DALL-E 3 image generation.

### 2. How to Use

1. **Select Image Mode**: On the homepage, select **"DALL-E 3"** from the "IMAGE MODE" dropdown
2. **Enter Prompt**: Describe the image you want to generate
   - Example: "A futuristic city with flying cars at sunset"
   - Example: "A portrait of a cyberpunk warrior with neon lights"
3. **Click "GENERATE IMAGE"**: Wait 1-3 minutes for your image to be created
4. **Download**: Once generated, you can view and download your image

### 3. Cost

Image generation costs **13 credits** per image.

**Pricing Breakdown:**
- DALL-E API Cost: ~5 credits
- User Cost: 13 credits (60% markup)
- Your Profit: ~8 credits per image
- **Comparison**: Videos cost 26 credits

### 4. Technical Details

#### Backend API Route
- **Location**: `/app/api/dalle-image/route.ts`
- **POST Endpoint**: Generates images using DALL-E 3

#### Frontend Integration
- **Location**: `/app/page.tsx`
- **Features**: 
  - DALL-E 3 selection in IMAGE MODE dropdown
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Image preview and download
  - Credit checking and deduction

### 5. Output Format

DALL-E 3 generates high-quality **static PNG images** (1024x1024 pixels).

**Features:**
- Standard quality by default (can be upgraded to HD)
- Square format (1:1 ratio)
- Perfect for web, social media, and print
- Instant download as PNG

### 6. Comparison: Image Mode Options

| Model | Type | Use Case | Output Format | Cost | Requirements |
|-------|------|----------|---------------|------|--------------|
| **"One" (BLIP)** | Vision Analysis | Analyze/caption existing images | Text response | 3 credits | Upload image |
| **"Dos" (LLaVA)** | Vision Analysis | Q&A about existing images | Text response | 3 credits | Upload image |
| **DALL-E 3** | Image Generation | Create static images from text | PNG image | 13 credits | Text prompt |

**For Video Generation**: Use VIDEO MODE with RunwayML Gen-3A Turbo, Gen-4 Turbo, or Gen-4 Aleph (26 credits, requires image input)

### 7. Generation Time

DALL-E 3 image generation is fast:
- **Average**: 20-40 seconds
- **Typical**: ~30 seconds

Much faster than video generation which takes 1-5 minutes.

### 8. Example Prompts

**Great prompts for image generation:**
- "A serene Japanese garden with cherry blossoms at dawn, photorealistic"
- "Abstract geometric patterns in neon colors, digital art style"
- "A dragon flying over medieval castle, fantasy art"
- "Minimalist logo design for a tech startup, modern and clean"
- "Cyberpunk street scene with rain and neon signs, cinematic"
- "Portrait of an alien explorer, sci-fi concept art"

**Tips for better results:**
- Be specific about style (photorealistic, digital art, cartoon, etc.)
- Include lighting details (sunset, neon, dramatic lighting)
- Mention mood or atmosphere (serene, energetic, mysterious)
- Specify composition (close-up, wide shot, aerial view)

### 9. Error Handling

The system handles:
- Missing API key
- Insufficient credits
- Generation timeouts
- API failures

All errors are displayed in the UI with clear error messages.

### 10. UI Features

**Visual Design:**
- Purple theme for image generation (matching your color scheme)
- Animated spinner during generation
- Progress messages
- Success notification with download button
- Static image preview with download as PNG

**Progress Updates:**
- "Preparing your image generation..."
- "Sending request to DALL-E 3..."
- "Image generated successfully!"

## Troubleshooting

### "RUNWAYML_API_SECRET environment variable is not set"
- Make sure you've added the API key to your `.env.local` file
- Restart your development server after adding the key

### "Insufficient credits"
- Image generation costs 13 credits
- Purchase more credits from the Credits page

### "Image generation timed out"
- The generation took longer than 10 minutes (rare)
- Try again with a simpler prompt

### Why not RunwayML for images?
- RunwayML's API requires an image input for their `imageToVideo` endpoint
- They don't currently support pure text-to-image generation
- RunwayML is best used for video generation (available in VIDEO MODE)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Your RunwayML API key is already configured
2. ✅ The image generation feature is now live
3. Test the image generation on your homepage!
4. Share the feature with your users

**Note**: This integration uses the official `@runwayml/sdk` package and RunwayML's Gen-4 model for high-quality image generation. The output format (video) is a current limitation of the API but provides unique motion graphic capabilities.
