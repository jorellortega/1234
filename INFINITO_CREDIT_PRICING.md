## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Video Pricing (URGENT)
```typescript
// app/page.tsx - Video credit costs
const videoCredits = {
  'gen4_turbo': 40,        // was 26
  'gen3a_turbo': 80,       // was 26
  'veo3.1': 320,           // was 26
  'veo3.1_fast': 160,      // was 26
  'veo3': 512,             // was 26 (8 seconds)
  'gen4_aleph': 120        // was 26
}
```

### Phase 2: Fix Image Pricing
```typescript
// app/page.tsx - Image credit costs
const imageCredits = {
  'dalle_image': 40,           // was 13
  'gen4_image': 8,             // was 16
  'gen4_image_turbo': 3,       // was 16
  'gemini_2.5_flash': 8,       // was 16
  'runway_image': 8            // was 16
}
```

### Phase 3: Fix Text Model Pricing
```typescript
// app/page.tsx - Text credit costs (per message)
const textCredits = {
  'gpt-4o': 5,                // was 1
  'gpt-4o-mini': 1,           // OK
  'gpt-4-turbo': 18,          // was 1
  'gpt-4': 43,                // was 1
  'gpt-3.5-turbo': 1,         // OK
  'o1': 32,                   // was 1
  'o1-mini': 6,               // was 1
  'o1-preview': 32,           // was 1
  'blip': 0,                  // was 3 (should be free)
  'llava': 0                  // was 3 (should be free)
}
```

### Phase 4: Add Audio Pricing
```typescript
// Charge per audio generation based on character count
const audioCreditsPerChar = 0.048 // 48 credits per 1000 chars
```

## Current Revenue Analysis

### What You're Currently Charging:
- Text: **1 credit/msg** (flat rate)
- Vision: **3 credits/msg**
- Image: **13-16 credits/img**
- Video: **26 credits/video** (flat rate)
- Audio: **0 credits** (free)

### What You're Actually Spending (API Costs):

**Video (biggest issue):**
- Gen4 Turbo: Charging 26, Costing 25 = **+1 profit** ‚úÖ (tiny margin)
- Gen3a Turbo: Charging 26, Costing 50 = **-24 loss per video** ‚ùå
- VEO 3.1: Charging 26, Costing 200 = **-174 loss per video** ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå
- VEO 3: Charging 26, Costing 320 = **-294 loss per video** ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

**Text (variable loss):**
- GPT-4o: Charging 1, Should charge 5 = **-4 loss per msg**
- GPT-4: Charging 1, Should charge 43 = **-42 loss per msg**
- O1: Charging 1, Should charge 32 = **-31 loss per msg**

**Image (some overpriced, DALL-E underpriced):**
- DALL-E: Charging 13, Should charge 40 = **-27 loss per image**
- RunwayML: Charging 16, Should charge 3-8 = **+8-13 overcharge** (compensating for other losses)

## Implementation Priority

1. **üö® URGENT: Fix video pricing** (currently losing money)
2. **üî¥ HIGH: Fix text model pricing** (GPT-4, O1 series underpriced)
3. **üü° MEDIUM: Fix image pricing** (DALL-E underpriced, RunwayML overpriced)
4. **üü¢ LOW: Add audio pricing** (currently free)

## Grandfather Clause Considerations

If users already bought credits at current prices, consider:
- **Grandfathering** existing credits (honor old pricing)
- **Clear communication** about new pricing
- **Grace period** before price changes
- **Credit bonuses** to ease transition
